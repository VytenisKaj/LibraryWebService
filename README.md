# Small library web service API

To launch you have to have [docker]("https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/") installed and opened:
1. Copy files from the repository to the desired location.
2. Open some kind of terminal application (bash, PowerShell, etc.)
3. Navigate to the directory, where you saved the files (should contain *.sln and docker-compose.yml files) 
4. Run `docker-compose up`
5. Wait until both services are started
6. Open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html`
7. Enjoy :)
