To launch you have to have docker installed and opened:

	2. Open some kind of terminal application (bash, powershell, etc.)
	3. Navigate to the directory, where you saved the files (should contain *.sln and docker-compose.yml files).
	4. Run `docker-compose up`
	5. Wait intil both services are started
	6. Open your favourite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html`
	7. Enjoy :)
